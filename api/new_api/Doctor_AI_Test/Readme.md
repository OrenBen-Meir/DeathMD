# Doctor AI Test

The following code in the folder is 
meant to test our new doctor AI using the csv files provided.
The Training.csv file will serve as our new training data to be migrated. Testing.csv will serve as testing data.
Please run accuracy_test.py to test the accuracy of our new 
machine learning AI.

The data came from the Symptom_checker dataset form Kaggle.

In addition our machine learning mechanism used and how it was tested is based on a kernel for this dataset on Kaggle called the [Disease Checking Bot](https://www.kaggle.com/sandeepbhutani304/disease-checking-bot).
